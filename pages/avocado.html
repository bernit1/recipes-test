        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An avocado is a bright green fruit with a large pit and dark 
            leathery skin. It's also known as alligator pear or butter fruit. 
            Avocados are a favorite of the produce section. They're the go-to 
            ingredient for guacamole dips.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An avocado</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Lime Juice</li>
            <li>Seasonings to enhance flavor and prevent browning</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Take your ripe avocado and place it on a board. 
                Using a sharp knife, cut lengthways around the entire fruit, 
                using your other hand to hold the avocado steady.</li>
            <li>Place your hands either side of the cut and twist to 
                split the avocado in half.</li>
            <li>Remove the stone by placing a spoon gently underneath it 
                and levering it up.</li>
            <li>Slice the two halves in half again and then peel away the skin 
                from the corners. You can then slice, mash or pur√©e the avocado 
                for your chosen dish, drink or snack!</li>
